# Debugging Concepts

## Approach
1. Reproduce the issue reliably
2. Isolate the problem area
3. Form hypotheses
4. Test systematically
5. Document findings

## Tools
- Print debugging (simple but effective)
- Interactive debuggers (pdb, ipdb)
- Logging at different levels
- Stack trace analysis

## Common Issues
- Off-by-one errors
- Null/undefined references
- Race conditions
- Type mismatches
- Scope issues
